This will be a growing collection of problems I am working on while reinforcing my C# and JavaScript programming. 
The pdf file in each problem folder has the problem to solve which can be done in the language of choice. The 
CodeStart file has the code template to get you started. I have included my solution for each problem, but of course
you should look at that later after doing the problem yourself.

These problems and more for several different languages can be found at: www.hackerrank.com
