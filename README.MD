This is a growing collection of problems I am working on while reinforcing my C# and JavaScript programming. 
The pdf file in each problem folder has the problem to solve which can be done in the language of choice.
I have included my solution for each problem which passed HackerRank's unit tests. They are not necessarily the best solution.

These problems and more for several different languages can be found at: www.hackerrank.com
