This will be a growing collection of problems I am working on while reinforcing my C# knowledge. The pdf file in each problem 
folder has the problem to solve which can be done in the language of your choice. The CodeStart file has the C# 
code template to get you started. I have included my solution for each problem, but of course you should look at
that later after doing the problem yourself.

These problems and more for several different languages can be found at: www.hackerrank.com
